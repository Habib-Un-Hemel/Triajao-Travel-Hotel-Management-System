## 1. Introduction
“**Triajao**” is a website that works like a bucket filled with hotels, tour guides,
and venue suggestions. Our website has 3 segments. One for customers, another
for hotel owners, and the last for tour guides. We are allowing rural people to
help the tourist visit their city. They can sign up just by filling out a form. About
hotels, managers can give all the details we need and enlist their hotel on our
website. Thus they can boost their hotel business. Last but not least, the
customer section, where people can book hotels, get suggestions about where to
visit depending on their desired destination, and book tour guides so they don’t
get lost. All these facilities are just one sign-up away.


## 2. Technologies
The project is built on HTML, PHP , Bootstrap, and MySQL. PHP is employed
to establish a connection with the database, execute SQL queries, and fetch data.
The presentation of the retrieved data is enhanced using HTML and Bootstrap.
The development focuses on creating a Travel & Hotel Management System,
incorporating the following features.

## 3. improving User Experience
This project leverages HTML and PHP to reduce
page loading times significantly. The inclusion of a search bar further enhances
user interaction, enabling them to easily locate hotels, guides, and travel
destinations based on their specific needs. This addition is designed with user
convenience in mind, aiming to streamline the overall experience on the
website.

## 4. Data Management and Security
To ensure seamless navigation, the website
incorporates a secure login and signup panel. User logins are safeguarded by
passwords, and in cases where the entered email and password do not match the
database records, an 'Invalid Username or Password' message is displayed.
Moreover, the signup process enforces mandatory field completion, and any
omission or incorrect data entry triggers an error prompt. By utilizing PHP and
SQL, the website obtains real-time data from the database, simplifying
processes such as hotel room booking and guide hiring.
